**************cleanup function**************************
here we should do exactly opposite to what we have done in init function
	1) void device_destroy(struct class   *class, dev_t dev);
	2) void class_destroy(struct class *class);
	3) void cdev_del(structt cdev *p);
	4) void unregister_chardev_region(dev_t from, unsigned count);

when we add a class we get a folder with given name in /sys/class which contains dev,uevents
dev has device numbers and device namae

class_destrroy will delete the class folder in in /sys/class
