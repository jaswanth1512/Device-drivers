********************Steps to establish connection btwn file access and driver******************
	1) Create a device number(Major number)
	2) Create a device files(Minor number)
	3) register then with VFS(Virtual file system)
	4) implement the driver's file operations for open,read,write...etc.
The above functionalities can be achived using kernal API's
1) create device number ---> alloc_chardev_region();
2) register then with VFS ---> cdev_init(); and cdev_add();
3) create device file ---> class_create(); and device_create();

onece created should also be removed.

************************dynamically register a range of char device number************************

the function used to allocate device number is as follows
int alloc_chardev_region(dev_t *dev, uinsigned int baseminor, unsigned int count, const char *name);

   -->1st arg   dev_t *dev, dev_t is unsigned int32, it a pointer which accepts the major number
   -->2nd arg   unsigned int baseminor , it is used as starting minor number.
   -->3rd arg   unsigned int count, this is used to tell the no of minor numbers required.
   -->4th ard   const char *namae, this is the name of that perticular range of minor numbers, but not the device name
   
dev_t is typedefined as uint32 where first 12bytes are used to store major number and last 20 bytes are used to store minor number
to extract major number we use a macro called MAJOR() and for minar number we use a macro MINOR()

snippet code:
	dev_t device_number;
	int minor_no = MINOR(device_number);
	int major_no = MAJOR(device_number);
	//thers are present in linux/kdev_t.h

**************************initlizing cdev structure*****************************
void cdv_init(struct cdev *cdev, const struct file-operations *fops);
   
   -->1st arg struct cdev *cdev, it is used to point cdev structure
   -->2nd arg const struct file_operations *fops, this is used to menton drive's file operation method or system call handler's like open,close..etc
   snippet code:
   	struct file_operations demo_fops;
   	struct cdev demo_cdev;
   	cdv-init(&demo_cde, &demo_fops);
   	
   cdev structure  in lincludes/linux/cdev.h-->


   struct cdev{
   	struct kobject kobj;
   	struct module *owner;                       --> owner should be initlized with the current module, generally with a macro called THIS_MODULE
   	const struct file_operations *ops;          -->pointer to file operation structure of the driver
   	struct list_head list;
   	dev_t dev;
   	unsigned int count;
   	}__randomize_layer;


************************adding cdev structure to kernel vfs************************
int cdev_add(struct cdev *p,dev_t dev,unsigned count);
	
	1st arg ---> struct cdev *p is a pointer to cdev structure
	2nd arg ---> dev_t dev is the device number
	3rd arg ---> unsigned count is the number of minor numbers corrosponding to this device.

************************system calls in driver***************************
int pcd_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
	return 0;
}
	inode is a vfs data structure that holds general information about a file
	struct file is a data structure that tracks interactions on an opened file by the user processes
	
    read write open lseek and release operations defination can be found in "modules/includes/linux/fs.h"
    its better to copy prototypr from there


***********************create device files*********************************
device files will be created automaticly 
udev:
udev relies on device information being exported to user space through sysfs.
class_Create:	
	create a directory in sysfs:/sys/class/<your_class_name>
device_create:
	this function creates a subdirectory under /sys/class/<your_class_name> with device name.	
	
struct class *class_create(struct module *owner, const char *name);
	example:
	struct class *ret_type
	ret_type = class_create(THIS_MODULE,"Device_name");
	
struct device *device_create(struct class *class, struct device *parent,dev_t devt, void *drvdata, const char *fmt,...);
	2nd arg can be used if there is a parent child hirarchoy.
	3rd arg si device number
	4th arg is data to be added to the device for callbacks
	5th arg will be 
	
	header file used is /linux/device.h
